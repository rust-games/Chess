# Gameplay

The player controlling the white pieces is named "White"; 
the player controlling the black pieces is named "Black". 
White moves first, then players alternate moves. 
Making a move is required; it is not legal to skip a move, 
even when having to move is detrimental. 
Play continues until a king is checkmated, a player resigns, 
or a draw is declared, as explained below. In addition, 
if the game is being played under a time control, 
a player who exceeds the time limit loses the game unless 
they cannot be checkmated.

The official chess rules do not include a procedure for determining who plays White. 
Instead, this decision is left open to tournament-specific rules 
(e.g. a Swiss system tournament or round-robin tournament) or, 
in the case of non-competitive play, mutual agreement, 
in which case some kind of random choice is often employed.
