# Promotion

If a player advances a pawn to its eighth rank, the pawn is then promoted (converted)
to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight of the same color at the choice of the player 
(a queen is usually chosen). The choice is not limited to previously captured pieces. 
Hence, it is theoretically possible for a player to have up to nine queens or 
up to ten rooks, bishops, or knights if all of their pawns are promoted.
