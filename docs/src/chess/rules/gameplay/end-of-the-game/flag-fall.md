# Flag-Fall

A game played under time control will end as a loss for a player who uses up 
all the time allotted on the player's clock, which is called flag-fall, unless 
the opponent has no possibility of effecting checkmate. 
There are different types of time control. 
A player may have a fixed amount of time for the entire game, 
or may have to make a certain number of moves within a specified time. 
Also, a small increment of time may be added for each move made.
