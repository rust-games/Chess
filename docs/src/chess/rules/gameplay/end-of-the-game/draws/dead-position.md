# Dead Position

A dead position is defined as a position where neither player can checkmate 
their opponent's king by any sequence of legal moves.

- Any positions with only the following pieces are dead positions, 
  and are known as draws by insufficient material:
  - king against king
  - king against king and bishop
  - king against king and knight
  - king and bishop against king and bishop, with both bishops on squares 
    of the same color (see King and two bishops).
- However, insufficient material is not the only condition for a dead position. 
  There are positions in which checkmate is impossible but the pieces on the board 
  would be sufficient to mate if arranged otherwise. 
  This usually occurs in blocked king and pawn endings where it is impossible 
  for either king to capture the pawns. See the diagram below.
