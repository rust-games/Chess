# Resigning

Either player may resign at any time, conceding the game to the opponent. 
A player may resign by saying it verbally or by indicating it on the scoresheet 
in any of three ways: (1) by writing "resigns", (2) by circling the result of the game, 
or (3) by writing "1–0" if Black resigns or "0–1" if White resigns. 
Tipping over the king also indicates resignation, but it should be distinguished 
from accidentally knocking the king over. Stopping both clocks is not an indication 
of resigning, since clocks can be stopped to call the arbiter. An offer of a 
handshake is sometimes used, but it could be mistaken for a draw offer.
