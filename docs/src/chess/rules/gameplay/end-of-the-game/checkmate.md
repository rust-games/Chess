# Checkmate

If a player's king is placed in check and there is no legal move that player 
can make to escape check, then the king is said to be checkmated, the game ends, 
and that player loses. Unlike other pieces, the king is never captured.

The diagram shows an example checkmate position. The white king is threatened 
by the black queen; the empty square to which the king could move is also threatened; 
and the king cannot capture the queen, because it would then be in check by the rook.
